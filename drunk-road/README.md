This is an exercise where starting from a point 0 we can randomly decide which direction to take, depending on the established options.

To carry out an example of randomness, we are going to create a program that will represent the "Drunk Road" problem. For this we will create 3 classes: one that represents the walking agent, one that generates an abstraction of the coordinates and one that represents the plane in which we are moving, and we are going to graph the distance in which our agent ends as we define a greater number of steps you can take.
